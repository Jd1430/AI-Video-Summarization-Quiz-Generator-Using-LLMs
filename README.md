# AI Video Summarization & Quiz Generator

## üìå Overview
This project is an AI-powered web application that allows users to upload a video file or paste a YouTube link. The system extracts the audio, transcribes it into text using Whisper AI, translates it into a selected language, and generates a detailed summary using Groq LLM. Additionally, an AI-powered quiz generator creates questions based on the transcript and summary, allowing users to test their understanding interactively. The quiz provides multiple difficulty levels, instant feedback, and a final score. It supports both YouTube videos and uploaded files.
